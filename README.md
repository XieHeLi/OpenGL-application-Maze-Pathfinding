# OpenGL-application-Maze-Pathfinding

This project utilize OPenGL to display the maze pathfinding. Noting that the path *s in the Maze_Project.cpp is an absolute path of the map. Hence it is needed to be revised before running this code. 
Furthermore, the map can be altered with the similar paradim of the txt file, which means the 1 and 0 represent the wall and road respectively.
The main function is located in the Maze_Project.cpp.
